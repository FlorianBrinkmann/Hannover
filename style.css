Description: Hannover is great for photographers. You can show all gallery and image posts on one portfolio page or only posts from one category. Besides that you can create category pages to show only a part from your portfolio and a archive function is integrated too. You can select from two page templates for your front page and display a random image from a gallery or display the gallery as a slider. Furthermore you can display all galleries on your page as a slider instead of showing the images singly.
